<p>My ideal web development job would be a hybrid position, mainly working remotely. I'm somewhat of a home body and I also just enjoy working at
my own pace and taking breaks when I need to or just grinding at 2am if I feel motivated. I still haven't decided on front-end or back-end as
I don't have too much experience yet. I will be searching for a position with minimum 70k a year. I have a lot of prior IT experience and certifications,
even if they don't directly apply to web development. I believe I could be a crucial addition to any team.</p>
